# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:
```bash
$ nim c -r test_sublist.nim
```

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/nim/sublist` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Exercises Directory`.
