# Space Age

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:
```bash
$ nim c -r test_space_age.nim
```

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/nim/space-age` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Exercises Directory`.
