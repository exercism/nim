# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:
```bash
$ nim c -r test_rna_transcription.nim
```

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/nim/rna-transcription` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Exercises Directory`.
